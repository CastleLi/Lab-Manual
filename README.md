# Introduction
Welcome to the LAB NAME Lab manual. This manual was inspired by other similar works, and borrows heavily from them (e.g., [this one](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) and [this one](https://github.com/memobc/memolab-manual)). It is intended to represent my vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing University of Missouri policies (which take precedence). We hope you’ll learn a lot about clinical statistics, develop new skills (coding, data analysis, writing, giving talks), make new friends, and have a great deal of fun throughout the whole process.

Upon joining the lab, all lab members are required to read the lab manual and sign a form indicating that they have done so.

This work is licensed under a CC Attribution 4.0 license. We expect that more information will be added and some sections will be revised as the lab grows and develops. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents of this manual, please tell me (mail address).

# Lab member expectations and responsibilities
## Everyone
### Big picture
- Do work that you are proud of. 
- Don’t rush your work. Double-check your work and ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. 
- Tell your collaborators if you do make a mistake (if they have already seen the results). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.
- No academic misconduct. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way.
- Be supportive of your labmates. Share your knowledge and help them out if they need help.
- Work independently when you can, ask for help when you need it.
- Respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.
- Take personal time/ vacation when you need it and cultivate a life outside of the lab. Respect that other lab members also have a life outside of lab.
- Communicate openly and respectfully with other members of the lab.
- If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Dr. Leary.

### Small picture
- Do not come into the lab if you are sick. Stay home and get healthy, and don't risk getting others sick.
- Notify the lab manager or me if you will be out, either due to illness or vacation. Make a note on the lab calendar. If you are sick and you had experiments or meetings scheduled that day, notify your participants or collaborators and reschedule.
- You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it).
- Show up to your meetings, classes, and exams – just show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done.
- Lock the doors to the lab if no one else is around, even if you're stepping out for a minute.
- Keep the lab tidy. Eating in lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.
- The dress code in academia is generally casual but not *too* casual. Don’t wear jeans, T-shirts or pajamas.
- Be on time. Especially when you are running participants – show up __ minutes early to set everything up. And be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable.

## YOUR TITLE or ROLE
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you can expect her to:
- Maintain a vision of where the lab is going
- Provide the funding necessary to keep the lab going
- Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
- Give you my perspective on academia and issues related to professional development
- Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, writing recommendation letters for you, providing you with opportunities to attend conferences when possible, and promoting your work in talks
- Care about you as a person and not just a scientist

## Postdocs
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Develop your own independent line of research
- Mentor undergraduate and graduate students on their research projects, when asked or when appropriate
- Apply for external funding.
- Apply for jobs (academic or industry) as soon as you are "ready" and/or by the end of beginning of your fourth year as a postdoc.
- If you are planning to pursue a non-academic career, treat your postdoctoral research as seriously as you might if you were pursuing an academic career. We can discuss ways of making sure that you are getting the training you need, while still doing excellent research.
- Remind the PI that different scientific opinions can co-exist in the same lab!

## Graduate students
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Develop a line of dissertation research. Ideally, your dissertation research will consist of at least 3 experiments that can be packaged into one thesis document.
- Apply for external funding. If nothing else, this is an extremely valuable experience, and it will release you from your TA-ing responsibilities.
- Do some soul-searching as to what type of career you want to pursue, e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing. We can brainstorm ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need.
- Work with a team of undergraduate students. This will speed up data collection and give you some experience with managing and mentoring a team.
- Stay up-to-date (and keep up-to-date) on any deadlines that you need to meet to fulfill departmental requirements.

## Lab managers
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Maintain the lab IRB protocols and paperwork (e.g., archiving consent forms).
- Oversee the hiring, scheduling, and training of undergraduate research assistants.
- Maintain the lab website.
- Assist with participant recruitment and scheduling.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Work on your own research project.

## Other full-time staff
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Work on your own research project.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager.

## Undergraduate students
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Work with the lab manager and/or your research mentor to determine your weekly schedule. If you are not able to come in during your normal scheduled time, you must let the lab manager know.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager (this may include filing paperwork). If you are in lab and do not have a task to do, you should ask the lab manager or your supervisor whether there is anything you can help out with.
- At the beginning of each semester, complete the start-of-semester form pinned to the `#undergrads` channel on Slack.
- At the end of each semester, complete the end-of-semester form pinned to the `#undergrads` channel on Slack.
- Undergraduates who work in the lab for a full semester may have the option to assist with an EEG project during the following semesters in the lab.
- Undergraduates who work in the lab for a full year may have the option to assist with an fMRI project during the following semesters in the lab.
- *If you are earning course credit for research, you must additionally:*
 - Attend at least one of our lab meetings or journal clubs per week.
 - Present at one meeting during the semester.
 - Write a short essay on your research topic or experiences at the end of the semester.
- For more information about undergraduate research positions, refer to the [Undergraduate research](#undergraduate-research) section below.

# Code of conduct
## General
Many topics were covered already in the [Lab member expectations & responsibilities](#lab-member-expectations-and-responsibilities) section.

**In addition:**

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. Please also see the University of Missouri [NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY]( https://missouri.edu/eeo-aa).

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery are generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Emily Leary immediately. If Dr. Leary is the cause of your concern, then please reach out to the department chair or another trusted departmental member who can assist.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

## Scientific integrity
### Reproducible research
Reproducible research is research that can be exactly reproduced given the *same* raw data. It is an *essential* part of science, and an expectation for all projects in the lab. Reproducibility is related to replicability, which refers to whether your results can be obtained again with a *different* data set. We expect that all of our research will be replicable, or, at least reproducible.

For results to be reproducible, it requires that you are organized and possess sufficient foresight to document each step of your research process. There are two main things you can do to improve the reproducibility of your research:
- Extensive note-taking. You will need extensive notes on each step of your analysis pipeline, explaining how you did things every step of the way (and the order that you did things), from any pre-processing of the data, to running models, to statistical tests. Your code should also be commented, and commented clearly. Comment your code so that every step is understandable by an outsider. 
- Programming workflows with version control. It is highly encouraged that you use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub) to keep track of what code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others.

### Authorship
We will follow APA guidelines with respect to authorship:

>"Authorship credit should reflect the individual's contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published."

Authorship will be discussed prior to the beginning of a new project, so that expectations are clearly defined. However, changes to authorship may occur over the course of a project if a new person becomes involved or if someone is not fulfilling their planned role. In general, graduate students and postdocs will be first authors on publications on which they are the primary lead, and Dr. Leary will be the last author.

#### Old projects
If a student or post-doc collects a dataset but does not completely analyze it or write it up within 3 years after the end of data collection, Dr. Leary will re-assign the project (if appropriate) to another person to expedite publication. If a student or post-doc voluntarily relinquishes their rights to the project prior to the 3-year window, Dr. Leary will also re-assign the project to another individual. This policy is here to prevent data (especially expensive data, e.g., fMRI) from remaining unpublished, but is meant to give priority to the person who collected the data initially.
## Human subjects research
Adherence to approved IRB protocols is *essential*, and non-adherence can lead to severe consequences for the entire lab. **All lab members must read and comply with the IRB consent form and research summary for any project that they are working on.** If you are not on the IRB, you cannot run participants, look at the data, analyze the data, or be in any way involved with the project. 

Lab members must also complete the CITI training and save their certificate. To be added to an existing IRB, talk to the lab manager and present them with your CITI certificate before you can work with human subjects. If there are any questions about the protocols, or if you're not sure whether we have IRB approval to run your study, please ask the lab manager or Dr. Leary for clarification. If necessary, the lab manager can file an amendment to an existing protocol or create a new protocol.

If you encounter any problems in the course of doing research that results in a negative outcome for the participant (e.g., if a participant becomes ill or upset, if there is an accident with the equipment, if there is a breach of confidentiality, etc), you should immediately seek assistance from Dr. Leary or the lab manager. If Dr. Leary am not around, you must notify Dr. Leary and the lab manager *within 24 hours*, preferably as soon as possible. In some cases, we may need to report this information to the IRB and/or our funding agencies.

# General policies
## Hours
One of the benefits of a career in academic research is that it is typically more flexible than other kinds of jobs. However, you should still treat it like a job. If you are employed for 40 hours a week, you should be working 40 hours a week. This applies to lab staff members (the lab manager and other research assistants) and postdocs. You are not required to work over-time. For graduate students, you are recognized with other demands on your time like classes and TA-ing but still expect to see you in lab, doing research, often. Lab staff members are expected to keep regular office hours (e.g., somewhere in the ballpark of 8-5). Graduate students and postdocs have more flexibility. 

### Your office hours

## Meetings
### Weekly lab meetings
Weekly lab meetings will be focused on project presentations and going over new data or methods. Lab meetings will last about 1 hour. If at the end of meeting, we need more time to discuss something, we will either take a break before continuing or schedule another meeting. Lab meeting agendas and notes will be maintained in the `lab meetings` folder on Box. All full-time lab members are expected to attend the weekly lab meeting. All part-time lab members (including undergraduates) are welcome to attend but attendance is not required.
### Individual meetings

## Deadlines
It is essential to keep works and deadlines organized. When it comes to deadlines, tell your collaborators **as soon as you know when a deadline is**, and make sure they are aware of it the closer it gets. Don’t be afraid to bug them about it.

Dr. Leary will expect # WEEK(S)’ notice for reading/ commenting on abstracts, papers, and manuscripts, filling out paperwork, etc, and # WEEK(S)’ notice for letters of recommendation. If you want feedback on research and teaching statements, or other work that requires multiple back-and-forth interactions between you and Dr. Leary before a hard deadline, give her as much time as you can.
## Presentations
It is therefore highly encouraged that you seek out opportunities to present your research, whether it is at departmental talk series and events, to other labs at conferences, or to the general public. If you are going to give a presentation (a poster or a talk), be prepared to give a practice presentation to the lab at least one week ahead of time (two weeks or more are advisable for conference presentations, and many weeks ahead of time are advisable for job talks, which require much refining).  Practice talks will help you feel comfortable with your presentation, and will also allow you to get feedback from the lab and implement those changes well in advance of your real presentation.

Templates for posters will be available, and you can use those as much or as little as you’d like. Some general rules for posters should be followed: minimize text as much as possible (if you wrote a paragraph, you’re doing it wrong), make figures and text large and easy to see at a distance, label your axes, and make sure different colors are easily discriminable. Other than that, go with your own style.
## Recommendation letters
Letters of recommendation are one of the many benefits of working in a research lab. You can count on Dr. Leary to write a letter if you have spent at least one year in the lab. (It’s hard to really know someone if they have only been around for a few months.) Exceptions can be made for shorter-term lab members in special circumstances (e.g., new graduate students or postdocs applying for fellowships). 

To request a letter of recommendation, please adhere to the deadline requirements described above, your current CV and any relevant instructions for the contents of the letter. Your specific aims or a short summary are required if you are applying for a grant. In some but not all cases, you may be asked to draft a letter, which will be revised to be consistent with evaluation. This will ensure that the letter contains all the information you need, and that it is submitted on time.

## Data management
### Storing active datasets (need to complete)
In general, data will be stored in one of three places:
- **Lab folder on secure departmental server**
 - Data to store here: consent forms, keys to subject IDs (identifiable data ok)
- **Box Folder**
 - Data to store here: behavioral data (no identifiable data!!!)


### Data organization
Your project folders should typically look something like this:
- `ProjectName/Data`
  - contains a folder for raw data - always keep a copy of the raw (i.e., unprocessed) data & keep it separate from the copy that you're using in your pipeline
  - processed data used in following steps – should be labeled clearly
  - this folder also contains a file documenting demographic & other summary info
- `ProjectName/Results`
 - contains folders or files of each type of results, e.g. report, summary
- `ProjectName/Program`
 - contains folders for code
- `ProjectName/Output`
 - contains the outputs of program
You are encouraged to use an organization scheme like this one. When you archive the dataset, you will be required to format it like this (or something similarly transparent in its organization), so might as well start that way. 

### Archiving inactive datasets
Before you leave the lab, you will be required to document and archive any dataset that you have collected. The dataset will be reviewed before you leave. [To add: information about where to archive data]

### Data sharing
Not only is data-sharing the right thing to do, we are actually required to do so for any dataset that was funded by the NIH. We will make these datasets publicly available within a year of publishing the first paper from the dataset. You should also be prepared to share any scripts that you used in your published processing & analysis pipeline. Currently, the best option for sharing smaller datasets seems to be the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), the best option for sharing MRI datasets is [OpenFMRI](https://openfmri.org/).

# Funding

## Allocation of expenses

## NIH funding notes
 All research funded by the NIH *must* acknowledge the grant number upon publication. This is essential for documenting that we are turning their money into research findings. We must also submit a yearly progress report describing what we have accomplished. Lab members involved in the research will be asked to contribute to the progress report.

# Undergraduate research
Undergraduate research assistants play an important role in our lab, and we have a few opportunities for them to earn money or credit for their contributions. Because these opportunities require a certain degree of commitment from both the student and the lab, we generally reserve them for students who have already spent at least one semester volunteering in lab. If this policy would prevent you from being able to work in lab, please talk to Dr. Leary or the lab manager because we want all students to be able to pursue their research interests. In addition to volunteering in lab, other research opportunities include:
