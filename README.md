# Introduction
Welcome to the LAB NAME Lab manual. This manual was inspired by other similar works, and borrows heavily from them (e.g., [this one](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) and [this one](https://github.com/memobc/memolab-manual)). It is intended to represent my vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing University of Missouri policies (which take precedence). We hope you’ll learn a lot about clinical statistics, develop new skills (coding, data analysis, writing, giving talks), make new friends, and have a great deal of fun throughout the whole process.
Upon joining the lab, all lab members are required to read the lab manual and sign a form indicating that they have done so.

# Lab member expectations and responsibilities
## Everyone
### Big picture
- Do work that you are proud of. 
- Don’t rush your work. Double-check your work and ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. 
- Tell your collaborators if you do make a mistake (if they have already seen the results). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.
- No academic misconduct. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way.
- Be supportive of your labmates. Share your knowledge and help them out if they need help.
- Work independently when you can, ask for help when you need it.
- Respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.
- Take personal time/ vacation when you need it and cultivate a life outside of the lab. Respect that other lab members also have a life outside of lab.
- Communicate openly and respectfully with other members of the lab.
- If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Dr. Leary.

### Small picture
- Do not come into the lab if you are sick. Stay home and get healthy, and don't risk getting others sick.
- Notify the lab manager or me if you will be out, either due to illness or vacation. Make a note on the lab calendar. If you are sick and you had experiments or meetings scheduled that day, notify your participants or collaborators and reschedule.
- You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it).
- Show up to your meetings, classes, and exams – just show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done.
- Lock the doors to the lab if no one else is around, even if you're stepping out for a minute.
- Keep the lab tidy. Eating in lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.
- The dress code in academia is generally casual but not *too* casual. Don’t wear jeans, T-shirts or pajamas.
- Be on time. Especially when you are running participants – show up __ minutes early to set everything up. And be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable.

## YOUR TITLE or ROLE
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you can expect me to:
- Maintain a vision of where the lab is going
- Provide the funding necessary to keep the lab going
- Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
- Give you my perspective on academia and issues related to professional development
- Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, writing recommendation letters for you, providing you with opportunities to attend conferences when possible, and promoting your work in talks
- Care about you as a person and not just a scientist

## Postdocs
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Develop your own independent line of research
- Mentor undergraduate and graduate students on their research projects, when asked or when appropriate
- Apply for external funding.
- Apply for jobs (academic or industry) as soon as you are "ready" and/or by the end of beginning of your fourth year as a postdoc.
- If you are planning to pursue a non-academic career, treat your postdoctoral research as seriously as you might if you were pursuing an academic career. We can discuss ways of making sure that you are getting the training you need, while still doing excellent research.
- Remind me (the PI) that different scientific opinions can co-exist in the same lab!

## Graduate students
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Develop a line of dissertation research. Ideally, your dissertation research will consist of at least 3 experiments that can be packaged into one thesis document.
- Apply for external funding. If nothing else, this is an extremely valuable experience, and it will release you from your TA-ing responsibilities.
- Do some soul-searching as to what type of career you want to pursue, e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing. We can brainstorm ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need.
- Work with a team of undergraduate students. This will speed up data collection and give you some experience with managing and mentoring a team.
- Stay up-to-date (and keep me up-to-date) on any deadlines that you need to meet to fulfill departmental requirements.

## Lab managers
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Maintain the lab IRB protocols and paperwork (e.g., archiving consent forms).
- Oversee the hiring, scheduling, and training of undergraduate research assistants.
- Maintain the lab website.
- Assist with participant recruitment and scheduling.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Work on your own research project.

## Other full-time staff
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Work on your own research project.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager.

## Undergraduate students
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Work with the lab manager and/or your research mentor to determine your weekly schedule. If you are not able to come in during your normal scheduled time, you must let the lab manager know.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager (this may include filing paperwork). If you are in lab and do not have a task to do, you should ask the lab manager or your supervisor whether there is anything you can help out with.
- At the beginning of each semester, complete the start-of-semester form pinned to the `#undergrads` channel on Slack.
- At the end of each semester, complete the end-of-semester form pinned to the `#undergrads` channel on Slack.
- Undergraduates who work in the lab for a full semester may have the option to assist with an EEG project during the following semesters in the lab.
- Undergraduates who work in the lab for a full year may have the option to assist with an fMRI project during the following semesters in the lab.
- *If you are earning course credit for research, you must additionally:*
 - Attend at least one of our lab meetings or journal clubs per week.
 - Present at one meeting during the semester.
 - Write a short essay on your research topic or experiences at the end of the semester.
- For more information about undergraduate research positions, refer to the [Undergraduate research](#undergraduate-research) section below.

# Code of conduct
## General
Many topics were covered already in the [Lab member expectations & responsibilities](#lab-member-expectations-and-responsibilities) section.

**In addition:**

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. Please also see the University of Missouri [NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY]( https://missouri.edu/eeo-aa).

### The Quick Version

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery are generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions.

### The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Maureen Ritchey immediately. If Maureen is the cause of your concern, then please reach out to the department chair or another trusted departmental member who can assist.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

## Scientific integrity
### Reproducible research
Reproducible research is research that can be exactly reproduced. This is related to replicability, in that it has to do with your ability to get the same results again, but it refers specifically to getting the same results given the *same set of data*. I expect that all of our research will be, at minimum, reproducible (I hope that it will also be replicable).

Conducting reproducible research is more difficult than it sounds, because it requires that you are organized and possess sufficient foresight to document each step of your research process. There are two main things you can do to improve the reproducibility of your research: 1) extensive note-taking (i.e., as much as you can manage) and 2) programming workflows with version control.

Programming workflows help with reproducibility because they take some of the human element out, and in an ideal scenario, you are left with a script or series of scripts that takes data from raw form to final product. Programming alone is not enough, though, because people can easily forget which script changes they made and when. Therefore, all projects that involve programming of any kind (so basically, all projects) must use some form of version control. I strongly recommend git in combination with GitHub (see below), unless you have a pre-existing workflow. This is a hard requirement because a) it is the only way to definitively track the evolution of methods/files over time, b) it allows for easier detection of bugs, c) it facilitates code sharing, and d) it has nice side effects for workflow organization (e.g., thinking in terms of commits, branches, issues). Points a, b, and c are directly relevant to the mission of conducting reproducible research.

### Experiment pre-analysis plans
We are currently working out a system for publishing pre-analysis plans for our studies. Stay tuned.

### Authorship
We will follow APA guidelines with respect to authorship:

>"Authorship credit should reflect the individual's contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published."

Authorship will be discussed prior to the beginning of a new project, so that expectations are clearly defined. However, changes to authorship may occur over the course of a project if a new person becomes involved or if someone is not fulfilling their planned role. In general, I expect that graduate students and postdocs will be first authors on publications on which they are the primary lead, and I will be the last author.

#### Old projects
For projects that required significant lab resources (e.g., fMRI or EEG studies or any other study requiring a great deal of time, money, or lab effort): Project "ownership" expires 3 years after data collection has ended (or whenever the original primary lead relinquishes their rights to the study, whichever comes first). At that point, I reserve the right to re-assign the project (or not) as needed to expedite publication. This policy is intended to avoid situations in which a dataset languishes for a long period of time, while still giving publication priority to the original primary lead.

## Human subjects research
Because we are engaged in human subjects research, it is of the *utmost importance* that we adhere to our approved IRB protocols. **All lab members must read and comply with the IRB consent form and research summary for any project that they are working on.** Lab members must also complete the CITI training and be added to the research personnel list before they can work with human subjects. If there are any questions about the protocols, or if you're not sure whether we have IRB approval to run your study, please ask the lab manager or me for clarification. If necessary, the lab manager can file an amendment to an existing protocol or create a new protocol.

If you encounter any problems in the course of doing research that results in a negative outcome for the participant (e.g., if a participant becomes ill or upset, if there is an accident with the equipment, if there is a breach of confidentiality, etc), you should immediately seek assistance from me or the lab manager. If I am not around, you must notify me *within 24 hours*, preferably as soon as possible. In some cases, we may need to report this information to the IRB and/or our funding agencies.
